DEPENDENCIES:
  - To run gardener_daemon.py, remote_gardener_cmd.py, or remote_gardener_gui.py you will need to have protocol buffers installed. 'pip install protobof' or some variation thereof ought to install the most recent version of protobuf. 5.27.2 is being used currently and is what garden_pb2.py was generated by. If a different of protobuf is installed then you will have to find the matching release protocol buffer compiler (protoc) from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases. You can then compile a new garden_pb2.py suitable for your version of protobuf doing something along the lines of 'protoc --python_out=./ garden.proto'.
  - To run remote_gardener_gui.py you will need the latest versions of PyQt6. Something along the lines of 'pip install PyQt6' ought to work for you.

BRIEF EXPLANATIONS OF SOURCE FILES:

garden.proto:
  - Holds the message definitions specified in a Google protocol buffer 3 standard.
  - They are currently compiled using version 5.27.2 of protobuf, if you are using a different version you should recompile them.

garden_pb2.py:
  - The compiled python version of the garden.proto. Will be generated when running the protoc compiler on garden.proto: 'protoc --python_out=./ garden.proto' or something along those lines.

garden_utils.py:
  - Contains the interface to my dad's Raspberry Pi's GPIO. He has 2 digital output devices configured to control the pump relay and valve solenoid. There are also 4 digital input devices to read the tank full, tank empty, well empty, and rain sensors.
  - If running on desktop you should probably leave DUMMY = True to use the duped versions of the gpiozero classes. Otherwise I imagine you would have to deal with actual gpiozero.

dummy_gpiozero.py:
  - Contains the duped versions of the digital output device and digital input device, to be used during development absent a Raspberry Pi.

garden_daemon.py:
  - Argument options:
      - --help
      - --host [-h] HOST, a valid HOST
      - --port [-p] PORT, a valid PORT (must be a non-negative integer)
      - --schedule_file [-sf] FILE_NAME
      - --log_file [-lf] FILE_NAME
  - This is the server meant to be run on my dad's Raspberry Pi Zero configured with the GPIO specified in garden_utils.py. If you're running this not on an RPi then you should leave DUMMY = True.
  - The main process is in charge of sending and receiving messages specified in garden.proto.
  - The gardener process is in charge of handling requests and running routine garden tasks (checking sensors and toggling the pump/valve as needed, etc).

remote_gardener_cmd.py:
  - A terminal version of the client. Has secret options -1 and -2. -1 allows you to toggle the state of a sensor when using the dummy_gpiozero classes. -2 allows you to shutdown the garden_daemon.py server.

remote_gardener_gui.py:
  - A GUI client built using PyQt6. During development on desktop, leave DEMO_MODE = True, this will allow you to toggle the state of sensors for testing while using dummy_gpiozero by clicking on the state of a sensor. Similar to -1 secret option while running remote_gardener_cmd.py.

day_schedule.py:
  - A GUI popup used to view times of day during which we are shceduled to water as well as schedule new watering events of unschedule existing events.

ui_files/remote_gardener.ui:
  -  A file created in Qt Designer from which we generate fresh versions of the remote_gardener_gui.py GUI (NONE OF THE CUSTOM LOGIC). Can be generated by running something along the lines of 'pyuic6 remote_gardener.ui -o remote_gardener.py'

ui_files/day_schedule.ui:
  - A file created in Qt Designer from which we generate fresh versions of the day_schedule.py GUI (NONE OF THE CUSTOM LOGIC). Can be generated by running something along the lines of 'pyuic6 day_schedule.ui -o day_schedule.py'
